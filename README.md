# For_my_beloved_bichon
* This website is for my pet dog. He has big dark eyes, just like the photos in the website shows. When I was home, he was
always happy and eager to explore new things. Because of him, I have taken much walk outside than I used to. I have been less lonely.
* I like to touch him and he likes to touch and licks my hand. Whenever I see his photo, I would remember how his hair touches my clothes.
* I miss him.
